# Strings in Java

## Overview
This section covers various algorithms and techniques for manipulating strings in Java. Strings are a fundamental data type used to represent sequences of characters and are crucial in solving many problems involving text processing, pattern matching, and data manipulation.

# Linked Lists in Java

## Overview
This section explores linked lists, a fundamental data structure in Java. Linked lists are used for their dynamic size and ease of insertion and deletion. They are key to understanding more complex data structures like stacks, queues, and graph representations.

# Queues in Java

## Overview
This section focuses on queues, a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Queues are widely used in scenarios where order matters, such as task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search in graphs.

# Stacks in Java

## Overview
This section discusses stacks, a linear data structure that operates on a Last In First Out (LIFO) basis. Stacks are used extensively in algorithms involving recursion, backtracking, expression evaluation, and syntax parsing.
